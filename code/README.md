# Code 

## Preparation
To avoid constructing graphs repeatedly and wasting time, we store information of nodes and relations for each time period in advance. 
### Data Preprocessing
**1. Prepare bill data**  
Our bill data comes from [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data) and [Yang et al.,](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zywei/data/fudan-
USRollCall.zip). To reserve bills and resolutions and convert votes into unified labels, we need to process the original csv files. You can find this in preprocess.py.  
After preprocessing, bill-related data is stored in pickle files named vote, bill2text, bill2year.
