## Preparation
To avoid constructing graphs repeatedly and wasting time, we store information of nodes and relations for each time period in advance. 
### Data Preprocessing
**1. Prepare bill data**
Our bill data comes from [Voteview](https://voteview.com/data). To reserve bills and resolutions and convert votes into unified labels, we need to process the original csv files. You can find this in preprocess.py.
