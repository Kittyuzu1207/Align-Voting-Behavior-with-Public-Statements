It involves 735 legislators who vote between 2009 and 2018. All tweets and following lists of them before July 20th,2020 are crawled. This version of dataset is what we used in our paper. Each json file stores tweets of a legislator, and file 'objid2account.pkl' can help find the mapping relationship between the official id of legislators and their twitter account.
